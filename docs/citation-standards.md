# Citation Standards

NEOC AI Assistant maintains academic integrity by following strict citation standards for all responses that reference external sources, research, or methodologies.

## IEEE Citation Style Requirements

All citations in NEOC AI Assistant responses must follow the IEEE citation style as defined in the IEEE Editorial Style Manual. When references are used, they must be included under a "Bibliography" section at the end of each response.

## Response Format

### With Bibliography
```
Based on current research in disaster management, early warning systems have proven effective in reducing casualties during natural disasters [1]. The integration of AI and machine learning has further improved prediction accuracy [2].

Bibliography

```

### Without Bibliography
If no external references are used in the response, no Bibliography section is required.

```
Flood mitigation strategies include structural measures like levees and dams, as well as non-structural approaches such as land-use planning and community education.

## Citation Rules

### When to Cite
- **Always cite** when referencing specific studies, research papers, or data
- **Always cite** when mentioning specific organizations, methodologies, or frameworks
- **Always cite** when quoting or paraphrasing from external sources
- **Always cite** when using statistical data or specific examples from research

### Citation Numbering
- Use sequential numbering starting from [1]
- Number citations in the order they appear in the text
- Each unique reference gets its own number
- The same reference can be cited multiple times using the same number

### Bibliography Section
- **Heading**: Always use "Bibliography" (not "References" or "Works Cited")
- **Placement**: Always at the end of the response
- **Formatting**: One citation per line, properly formatted in IEEE style
- **Completeness**: Include all necessary bibliographic information

## Quality Assurance

NEOC AI Assistant responses are validated to ensure:
- All cited references are accurately formatted in IEEE style
- Bibliography sections are only included when references are actually used
- Citation numbers correspond correctly to bibliography entries
- All citations contain sufficient bibliographic information

## Examples in Context

### Disaster Management Response
```
Tsunami early warning systems have evolved significantly since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Modern systems integrate multiple sensors including seismometers, tide gauges, and GPS buoys to provide accurate predictions within minutes of an earthquake [1].

The effectiveness of these systems was demonstrated during the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, where proper warnings saved thousands of lives [2]. However, challenges remain in developing countries where infrastructure limitations hinder system implementation [3].
